This entity represents an individual Member. A Member entity stores all the 
information about that entity. 

Members can be in the following states:
* Active - active member in good standing
* Inactive - a member who has not been active for a period of time (TBD)
* Suspended - a member who's account has been suspended due to violations of
  user agreements or similar reasons. Suspended members may be reinstated by
  an Admin once reparations have been made.
* Terminated - a member who has exercised their "right to be forgotten". In this
  state, the unique Id is retained but all other information is removed.
