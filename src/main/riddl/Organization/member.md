Members are the registered users and external entities of the organization at large. In a High School setting Member types include the following:
* FacultyStaff - Teachers and administrative support employees within the organization
* Student - students at the organization
* Vendor - an entity authorized to sell goods at organization events
* Sponsor - an entity who contributes monitary means or other material assets to the Organization, possibly in exchange for recognition (limited advertising) at organization events
* General - the default member type
* Alumni - A member who at one time was a student or Faculty/Staff member at the organization
* Parent - A member who has legal guardianship over an active student at the organization

As other application domains for Improving.app are explored other Member types may be added.

Organizational membership is necessary to view details of private organizations or events that are private to the sponsoring organization. User type may further restrict details that are visible within the organzaiton.

Improving.app, the Organizations the member belongs to, and the user themselves may persist certain information about the member. For example, the member may save personal information, payment methods to ease transactions, and so on. An organization may track a member's attendance to events and anonymized demographic data. And so on.

Members may act as an Admin for an organization that they belong to within limits. For example, it may be defined that only a Member of type FacultyStaff may be an admin for the BaseOrganization. Maybe it is defined that Vendors, and Sponsors, may not be an Admin for any organization. A member may have several types simultaneously. For example, a Member may be both FacultyStaff and a Parent at the same time. All members by default are General Members.

Guests are similar to Members in that they can view public events and organizations, and may purchase items to and at organization events. However, the big difference between Guests and Members is that Guests have no identity in the system. They cannot save any personal information. Nor can they be members of an organization. If a guest makes two purchases, each purchase will be tied to a unique GuestId, and the Guest must reenter payment informaiton for each purchase.
