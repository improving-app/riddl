Only provide the values of the elements of the VenueInfo type you
wish to change. For example, if you wish to define a new location, only
provide the location attribute with the ID of the new location. Whatever
values you provide will overwrite what was previously there. The absence of
an attribute means leave that value as is. If an empty value to an
attribute is provided, the value will be overwritten with an empty
value.
