We find that often these organizations have many pressing needs that take priority over these \u0026ldquo;minor\u0026rdquo; details. Events and the vending that happens at them often bring sorely needed revenue into the organization, are neglected and become subject to conflict and infighting, have high organizational leadership turnover (think PTO President or Booster Club President), and leaves administration frustrated, confused, and distrusting. Because of this distrust, many processes and controls are instituted that frustrate and complicate volunteer leadership that ultimately prevent them from doing a better job for the school.\nBeyond the obvious need that a platform such as this fills, we also think that it is a tremendous asset to provide students at a high school real-world business experience. Imagine if a group of teachers, administrators, and staff became a board of directors that selected each year, from the student body, a CEO, CTO, CMO, CFO, etc. Imagine these students leaving high school with a resume that, beyond a high school diploma, details their involvement with these businesses; how they increased attendance at school events, how they improved margin, how they attracted more sponsors, how they managed staff, how they improved efficiency, how they planned inventory, and so on.\nImprovingApp is a reference application for YoppWorks/Improving. It demonstrates the very best of Reactive Architecture, Domain Driven Design (DDD), Distributed Computing, Cloud Native Deployment, CI/CD, Agile Development, RIDDL, Test Automation, and Actor Systems (Akka, Vert.X, Spring, etc.). Inherint in this reference application is the ability to stand up demo sites quickly so that we can demonstrate to potential clients the advantages of YoppWorks/Improving preferred technologies and practices. We should be able to demonstrate clearly through real life metrics (number of users, number of orders processed, number of organizations supported, elasticity, etc.) the value of the platform and the technologies and processes used to implement it. We should be able to demonstrate through chaos engineering the responsiveness, resiliance, and elasticity of the technologies used in implementing the platform. The reference application will also be used in training curricula on the above technologies and processes for YoppWorks/Improving.\nWe think this platform could further be monitized (beyond the secondary education market) to include collegiate environments, professional athletics, grass roots events like farmer\u0026rsquo;s markets and craft fairs, food trucks, on-line ordering for restaurants, merch sales for concerts, and so on. The key unifying characteristics include one or more of the following:\ne-commerce activity where delivery of purchased goods is taken in person, there is a series of events that must be calendared and coordinated, audiences to engage (sponsorships, advertised promotions, information shared, and so on), or staff to be sheduled and coordinated. The languages, frameworks, and platforms used to develop ImprovingApp include the following:\nUI: Framework: Dart/Flutter Targets: PWA, Android, iOS, Mac, Windows CDN: Google BE: Languages: Scala, Java, Python, JavaScript (TypeScript and other variants), F#, C# Actor Models: Akka, Akka.NET, Kalix (Akka Serverless) Design: Polyglot Microservices, Possibly with Node? Messaging: gRPC/ProcolBuffers, Google Pub/Sub Runtime: GraalVM/11, Akka.NET 6 Infrastructure: GKE Kubernetes Databases: Cassandra for Event Sourcing, Postgres/MySQL/Neo4J for views/projections To summarize the motivations behind the development of the ImprovingApp:\nA full open-source, cloud-native, reactive microservices-based demonstrantion for What it is that we do at Improving Ottawa.

This should be centered around a fictitions organization (name needed. Ideas that have been proposed include Hogwarts, Whoville High, etc.) that operates in demo mode, and separately from \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;live\u0026rdquo; organizations and their events.\nConscious Capitalism There are many threads of Conscious Capitalism built into this application, particularly when applied to a secondary education context (or even post-secondary). Here are some ideas\nThis application is a learning platform. Students wanting to learn how modern applications are built could analyze this application as a case study. Students could be encouraged to extend and customize the application - increasing their learning and application Students could look at data generated by the application to learn about marketing, supply chain management, commerce, event management, communications, etc. This application is real It manages functioning businesses that operate under the Root Organization These businesses are limited in scope so damages from mismanagement are limited. School Administrators (board of directors) could appoint from the student body each year a CEO, CFO, CMO, CTO to manage these businesses with oversight from the board.

In this RIDDL definition we have only provided a single definition for Organization. However, as visualize Organization there are two types of organizations: BaseOrganizations and SubOrganizations. The BaseOrganization has no parent and is the financially responsible entity. There is exactly one BaseOrganization within an organizational structure. (Improving.App at large is designed as a multi-tenant system so there could be multiple BaseOrganizations defined, but there is no relationship between BaseOrganizations). Licensing and processing fees are paid by the BaseOrganization and revenue from sales activities are paid back to the BaseOrganization (who may decide if/how to distribute those funds to their SubOrganizations). Every other Organization within the structure is necessarily a SubOrganization.\nFor the remainder of this document we will either use Organization generically or we will provide a more specific term to make clear the \u0026ldquo;roles\u0026rdquo; of organizations in various contexts. For example, Parent Organization and Child Organization are useful terms to describe the relationship between two organizations. Organizations are arranged in a tree-like structure with the BaseOrganization at the base of that structure. A child organization is a subset of a parent organization. For example, you may have a Football team organization (parent), that has child organizations of Varsity, Junior Varsity, Sophomore, and Freshman teams. A Parent Organization could be a Child to yet another Organization. Another way to say this is, being a Parent Organization does not necessarily mean it is also a BaseOrganization.\nOrganizations can be in one of the following states:\nDraft: an organization that is in process of being defined. Active: an organization that is fully defined and currently in use. Inactive: an organization that may be fully defined but is not in use. This state is typically self induced, for example, the school year ends. Suspended: an organzation that is non-functioning because of violation of terms, non-payment, or similar reason. If these concerns are remedied the organizaton may be moved back to active status by a BaseOrganization Admin. Terminated: an organization that is non-functioning and will not or cannot be brought back to active status. Typically, only the organization ID and Name are retained to maintain internal consistency.
